# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

Created a calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app features HTML, CSS and is powered by jQuery. 

Using Day.js library to work with date and time, this application displays the current day and time for the user. 

When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. On scroll the user is presented with the time blocks for standard business hours. The time blocks are color coded to know whether the time is in the past, present, or future. The user can input the days activities or tasks and save them in local storage, when the page is refreshed the event remains in the time block.
